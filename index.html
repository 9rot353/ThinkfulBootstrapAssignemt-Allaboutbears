      <p>
     Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long
     and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds
     (the polar bear). They're found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
     They have nonretractable claws, short tails, and excellent sense of smell. They're typically solitary,
     except for mothers with cubs. There are eight species: Asiatic black bears (also called moon bears),
     brown bears (which include grizzly bears), giant pandas, North American black beras, polar bears,
     sloth bears, spectacled bears (also called Andean bears), and sun bears. 
    </p>

    <p>
     On average, bears can live up to 25 years in the wild and 50 in capitivity. Six species, including
     the polar bear and the giant panda, are included on the IUCN Red List as threatened or vulnerable.
